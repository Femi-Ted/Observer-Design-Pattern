# Observer-Design-Pattern: 

A Design Pattern Presentation.

Introduction:
Of the twenty-three design patterns focused on in the “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software” textbook by the “Gang of Four” (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides), the Observer Design Pattern belongs to the Behavioural Design Patterns class, a classification of design patterns that are largely concerned with maintaining communication between objects, and how they interact and distribute responsibilities between objects [1].
